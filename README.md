Cards Homework/Evening Reinforcement Work (Tuesday, April 11)
=============================================================


Description of Intent
---------------------

Reworked and rewrote assignment as demonstrated in DevJanaPrime's github: psi_cardsLecture2.  This was done as reinforcement
of the day's lecture to help solidify knowledge and learning.  See Dev's forked repository (jQuery (psi_cardsLecture2) for 
comparison.  Work was done with as much independence as possible to recreate needed code.


Activity Description
--------------------

Files are set up to create a way for user to add cards into a deck.  Cards are created using a custom constructor.  The 
card number and suit are stored in a card object and then pushed into a deck array.  The deck is displayed on the DOM.
